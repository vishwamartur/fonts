Note: If you are using WSL Ubuntu and experiencing issues with icons not showing correctly, follow these steps to install and configure fonts:

1. Install the necessary packages:
::
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install fonts-powerline

2. Configure the font settings in your terminal emulator (e.g., Windows Terminal, Hyper, etc.) to use a Powerline font.

3. If the issue persists, try using the DejaVu or Sarasa Term SC fonts, as they have been reported to work correctly on WSL Ubuntu.
